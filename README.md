# Energy Trading via Smart Contracts

## Overview
Due to the recent advances in household-level renewable electricity generation technology, a new type of market based on peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading between households will emerge.
Here we created a prototype of such a P2P trading platform using following components and libraries:
### Robsten Testnet
For the deployment of our Ethereum smart contracts
### Web3 Library
For the interaction between the testnet and our application
### Flask
For the API to our system
### Owlready2
For the semantic enrichment of the data.

## Execution
run smarthome.py
